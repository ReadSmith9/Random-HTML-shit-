    <p>The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.</p>

        Hi, I'm Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights? The constitution says you do! And so do I.

        Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?

        For a substantial fee, and I do mean substantial, you and your loved ones can vanish. Untraceable.

        I want it in a money order and make it out to Ice Station Zebra Associates. That's my loan out. It's totally legit … it's done just for tax purposes. After that we can discuss Visa or Mastercard, but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask, all right?

        You're a high-risk client. You're gonna need the deluxe service. It's gonna cost you.

        If you're committed enough, you can make any story work. I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it.

        I never should have let my dojo membership run out.

        Better safe than sorry. That's my motto.

        As to your dead guy, occupational hazard. Drug dealer getting shot? I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it's been known to happen."

        Don't drink and drive, but if you do, call me.
